# Checklist of what we need to write:
#   - gui
#   - data structure
#   - Smartass computer
#     simple idea:
#     Computer calculates all possible moves, chooses
#     the one with the highest chance of winning.
#     Maybe multiple difficulties, with lower difficulties
#     picking the ones with lower chance of winning (or
#     even choosing at random).

# Coordinates will be tuples of (x,y,z)

# Board will be size*size*size
size = 3

# Data functions
