# Checklist of what we need to write:
#   - GUI
#       Simple Pygame crap? How is the 3D viewing going to
#       work? Any pretty animations involved?
#
#   - Data structure
#
#   - Smartass computer
#       Simple idea:
#         Computer calculates all possible moves, chooses
#         the one with the highest chance of winning.
#         Maybe multiple difficulties, with lower difficulties
#         picking the ones with lower chance of winning (or
#         even choosing at random).

# Coordinates will be tuples of (x,y,z)

# Board will be size*size*size
size = 3

# Data functions
def change_value(coordinates,value,game_space):
    game_space = None
    return game_space

def return_value(coordinates):
    value = None
    return value

def Main():
    Done = False
    while not Done:
        pass
