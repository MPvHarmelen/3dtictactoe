# Checklist of what we need to write:
#   - gui
#   - data structure
#   - Smartass computer
#     simple idea:
#     Computer calculates all possible moves, chooses
#     the one with the highest chance of winning.
#     Maybe multiple difficulties, with lower difficulties
#     picking the ones with lower chance of winning (or
#     even choosing at random).

# Coordinates will be tupples of (x,y,z)

# Constants
size = 3

# Data functions
def change_value(coordinates,value,game_space):
    game_space = None
    return game_space

def return_value(coordinates):
    value = None
    return value
